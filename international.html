            <h2 style="background-color:black; color: white">Turkey U.S. row: Erdogan 'upset' by visa</h2>
            <p style="background-color:black; color: white"><p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described a US decision to suspend most visa services as "upsetting".
            <p>He said Turkish officials had contacted their US counterparts about the move, which was prompted by the detention last week of a Turkish national working at the US consulate in Istanbul.
                Turkey has also suspended visa services in the US.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors are seeking another consulate worker for questioning as a suspect, the state news agency reports.
                The first worker was held over alleged links to a cleric blamed for the failed 2016 Turkish coup, but no reason has been given for the latest action. The row has driven down Turkey's currency and stocks.
                "This decision is very, very saddening. For the Ankara [US] embassy to take a decision like this, to put into practice is saddening," Mr Erdogan said at a news conference in the Ukrainian capital Kiev.
                Several Turkish news networks announced earlier on Monday that a warrant had been issued for a second US consulate worker.</p>
            <p>Turkish officials have not confirmed the warrant, but later the state news agency Anadolu reported that prosecutors were seeking the man for questioning as a suspect, adding that he did not have diplomatic immunity.
                It said the suspect's wife and child had been detained in the city of Amasya, in northern central Turkey.</p>
            <p>Erdogan's Turkey: The full story
                Who is affected by the latest moves?
                Turkish citizens are no longer able to get visas to the US unless they are permanently moving there.
                In its statement on Sunday, the US embassy in Ankara said: "Recent events have forced the United States government to reassess the commitment of government of Turkey to the security of US mission and personnel.
                "In order to minimise the number of visitors to our embassy and consulates while this assessment proceeds, effective immediately we have suspended all non-immigrant visa services at all US diplomatic facilities in Turkey."
                In the 2016 fiscal year, the US issued 82,735 non-immigrant visas in Istanbul and 30,505 in Ankara, according to state department figures.
                The Turkish statement mimicked the American one, but said that "effective immediately we have suspended all visa services regarding the US citizens at our diplomatic and consular missions in the US".
                It added: "This measure will apply to sticker visas as well as e-visas and border visas."
                Meanwhile Turkish Airlines announced that passengers with tickets to and from the US up until 31 October were eligible for refunds or exchanges, the pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak reported.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:white; color: black">North Korea hackers steal U.S.-South Korea's War Plans</h2>
            <p style="background-color:white; color: black">p>Hackers from North Korea are reported to have stolen a large cache of military documents from South Korea, including a plan to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un.
                Rhee Cheol-hee, a South Korean lawmaker, said the information was from his country's defence ministry.
                The compromised documents include wartime contingency plans drawn up by the US and South Korea.
                They also include reports to the allies' senior commanders.</p>
            <p>The South Korean defence ministry has so far refused to comment about the allegation. Plans for the South's special forces were reportedly accessed, along with information on significant power plants and military facilities in the South.</p>
            <p>Mr Rhee belongs to South Korea's ruling party, and sits on its parliament's defence committee. He said some 235 gigabytes of military documents had been stolen from the Defence Integrated Data Centre, and that 80% of them have yet to be identified.
                The hack took place in September last year. In May, South Korea said a large amount of data had been stolen and that North Korea may have instigated the cyber attack - but gave no details of what was taken. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports that Seoul has been subject to a barrage of cyber attacks by its communist neighbour in recent years, with many targeting government websites and facilities.
                The isolated state is believed to have specially-trained hackers based overseas, including in China.
                North Korea has accused South Korea of "fabricating" the claims.</p>
            <p>News that Pyongyang is likely to have accessed the Seoul-Washington plans for all-out war in the Koreas will do nothing to soothe tensions between the US and North Korea.
                The two nations have been at verbal loggerheads over the North's nuclear activities, with the US pressing for a halt to missile tests and Pyongyang vowing to continue them. The North recently claimed to have successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb, which could be loaded onto a long-range missile.
                In a speech at the UN in September, US President Donald Trump threatened to destroy North Korea if it menaced the US or its allies, and said its leader "is on a suicide mission". Mr Kim responded with a rare statement, vowing to "tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire".</p>
            <p>Mr Trump's latest comment took the form of a cryptic tweet at the weekend, where he warned that "only one thing will work" in dealing with North Korea, after years of talks had proved fruitless. He did not elaborate further.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:black; color: white">Spain Catalan crisis: Puigdemont to address region's future</h2>
            <p style="background-color:black; color: white"><p>Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has delayed an announcement of plans for the future of the Spanish province.
            There was speculation that he was about announce a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain following a disputed referendum.
            But a session of the regional parliament was delayed by an hour, amid growing demands for him to drop plans to break away.
            Reports say Catalan party leaders are meeting before the session begins.</p>
            <p>Catalan police have been posted outside the parliament in Barcelona, sealing off the grounds to the public. Earlier, the mayor of Barcelona has urged Mr Puigdemont and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to "de-escalate" the crisis.
                The Madrid government called on the Catalan leader "not to do anything irreversible, not to pursue a path of no return and not to make any  unilateral independence declaration".
                And the president of the EU's European Council has appealed to him to respect Spain's constitutional order.
                A vote was held on 1 October which Catalan officials say resulted in almost 90% of voters backing independence for the north-eastern region. Turnout was put at 43%.
                The vote was deemed illegal by Madrid and suspended by Spain's Constitutional Court. "No" voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they manhandled voters.</p>
            <p>Analysis: Will Puigdemont make good his threat?</p>
            <p>Never before has the world watched Catalonia's regional parliament so closely. This evening, with probably large numbers of police and protesters outside, the leader of the devolved government is due to address Catalan MPs. Carles Puigdemont plans to present his government's results of the disputed referendum, which Madrid declared illegal.
                Since then, Mr Puigdemont has said on several occasions that he will declare independence, despite fierce opposition across Spain and criticism from European governments.
                Now, will he make good his threat? Or will he announce a more nuanced strategy, hoping still for a proper, recognised referendum one day? Under pressure to act, the Spanish government has made stark warnings, too. If the order comes, thousands of Spanish national police, here in Barcelona, could intervene.
                Grey line
                What security measures are being taken?
                The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, closed the Ciutadella Park, where parliament is located, early in the day, positioning vans near the entrances and alongside parliament.
                The authorities said the measures were "for safety reasons". The Catalan National Assembly (ANC), a non-party grassroots movement, earlier urged supporters in a tweet to come to the parliament district to "defend" the vote for independence. What is Puigdemont likely to tell parliament?
                Independence supporters have been sharing the Catalan hashtag #10ODeclaració (10 October Declaration) on Twitter.
                Expectations are high that Mr Puigdemont will ask parliament to declare independence on the basis of the referendum law it passed last month.
                Parliament, which is dominated by pro-independence parties, would then have 48 hours to vote. Barcelona's influential mayor, Ada Colau, has urged Mr Puigdemont not to declare independence. She also called on Mr Rajoy to rule out direct control from Madrid.
                European Council President Donald Tusk said: "A few days ago I asked Prime Minister Rajoy to look for a solution to the problem without the use of force, to look for dialogue, because the use of dialogue is always better than the argument is better of force.
                "Today I ask you [Mr Puigdemont] to respect in your intentions the constitutional order and not to announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible.
                "Diversity should not and need not lead to conflict whose consequences would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for whole of Europe."
                When the BBC asked people for their opinion in Barcelona, one woman, Eva Iniesta, called for the Spanish government to open a "dialogue so independence is not declared".
                But another person, Salvador Puig, said: "We have demonstrated and said that we don't like being part of this home and we have the right to live in the home we want and in the way we want."
                How is Madrid likely to react?
                Mr Rajoy is due to appear in Spain's parliament on Wednesday. He has already said any declaration of independence by Catalonia would "lead to nothing". Under Article 155 of the constitution, his Spanish government could suspend devolution.
                The leader of Spain's main opposition party, Pedro Sánchez of the Socialists, has said his party will back action by the government "in the face of any attempt to break social harmony".</p>
                <p>What pressure is big business exerting?</p>
                <p>A stream of companies have announced plans to move their head offices out of Catalonia in response to the crisis.
                It is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, accounting for a quarter of the country's exports.
                Publishing company Grupo Planeta is the latest to announce it will move from Barcelona to Madrid if there is a declaration of independence.
                Do the separatists have support internationally?
                The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU.
                A European Commission spokesman told Reuters news agency it called on "all those concerned to get of this confrontation as quickly as possible and to start dialogue". The EU, he added, had confidence "in the capacity of Prime Minister Rajoy to manage this delicate process in full respect of the Spanish constitution and the basic fundamental rights of the citizens".
                Austrian Finance Minister Hans Jörg Schelling warned the effects of Catalan independence could spread beyond Spain.
                "I hope that this won't lead to a crisis in the euro and in the EU but the danger naturally exists because extreme positions are clashing," he said.</p>
                <p>How did we reach this crisis?</p>
                <p>Catalonia, a part of the Spanish state for centuries but with its own distinct language and culture, enjoys broad autonomy under the Spanish constitution.
                However, a 2005 amendment redefining the region as a "nation", boosting the status of the Catalan language and increasing local control over taxes and the judiciary was reversed by the Constitutional Court in 2010.
                The economic crisis further fuelled discontent and pro-independence parties took power in the region in the 2015 elections.
                Attempts to hold a legal Scottish-style referendum on independence have got nowhere with the Spanish government.</p>

            <p style="background-color:white; color: black"><p>Greece's parliament has approved a new law that will make it easier for people to change their legal gender.
            Citizens over the age of 15 will now be able to change their gender with a court ruling and without requiring a medical operation.
            LGBT activists said the new law was an improvement, but criticised it for not doing enough to establish "full self-determination" for transgender people.</p>
            <p>The Greek Orthodox Church said the move was "immoral".
            The bill, which passed by 171 votes in Greece's 300-seat parliament, removes medical requirements from the process of changing legal gender.</p>
            <p>Under the old law, those wanting to change their gender on official documents had to undergo sex-change surgery and medical tests.
            This was heavily criticised by human rights groups and LGBT activists. ILGA-Europe, an LGBT rights advocacy group, described it as an "outdated and oppressive practice that violates individuals' bodily integrity".</p>

            <p style="background-color:black; color: white"><p>A 10-year-old Indian rape victim, who gave birth to a baby girl in August, had been made pregnant by one of her uncles, police say.
            Police are filing charges against the suspect - who is the second uncle of the girl's to be accused of raping her.
            The first uncle has already been held and charged with raping the girl.
            But police began looking for a second suspect after forensic tests revealed that the baby's DNA samples did not match those of the first accused.
            Chandigarh senior superintendent of police Neelambari Vijay told the BBC that police were now rushing to also file charges against the second uncle - who is the younger brother of the first uncle.</p>
            <p>"It's true the Baby's DNA sample has matched that of the [second] uncle," she said.
            The next hearing in the case will be held at a local court later on Tuesday.
            The first uncle will remain in custody as he is believed to have also abused the child.</p>
            <p>The harrowing case of the 10-year-old has made headlines for weeks, both in India and globally, says the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi.
            Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of a stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital.
            A local court in Chandigarh turned down the abortion plea on the grounds that she was too far into her pregnancy after a doctors' panel advised that termination of the pregnancy would be "too risky". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds.
            Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger.</p>
