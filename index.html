            Rice County prosecutors say Jeremiah Jon Smith told people he had stage 4 cancer, and collected nearly $7,000 from a 'GoFundMe' account based on the fraudulent claim. Investigators say Smith told people he had only six months to live, and that he had gone to two or three appointments with a specialist but refused to allow his wife to come along.
