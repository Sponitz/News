            <p style="background-color:black; color: white">
            <p>CLEVELAND — When the Mets launched their fire sale this summer, willing to take penny-stock prospects for the raft of veterans they were intent on unloading, there were two teams that jumped to the head of the line for outfielder Jay Bruce: the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians.<p/>
            <p>The Yankees offered two middling prospsects for Bruce but refused to pick up more than a small portion of the $3.7 million remaining on his contract.</p>
            <p>The Indians offered only a fringe prospect - a 30th-round draft pick who had been converted from pitcher to infielder - but they offered to pick up the rest of Bruce's contract, and the Mets accepted.</p>
            <p>If money was truly the difference in the deal, it also became the pivot point in the opening game of the teams' American League division series on Thursday night.</p>
            <p>Bruce h it a two-run homer, had three R.B.I. and scored twice, providing ample support behind the dominant pitching of Trevor Bauer in a 4-0 victory over the Yankees.</p>
            <p>Bauer held the Yankees without a hit for five and two-thirds innings and allowed just two hits before relievers Andrew Miller and Cody Allen polished off the shutout as the Yankees managed just one more hit, off Allen.</p>
            <p>Their best chance to rally came when Miller — whom they traded to Cleveland midway through the 2016 season — walked Chase Headley and Brett Gardner with two outs in the eighth. But Allen entered and got Aaron Judge to chase a 3-2 curveball in the dirt, the fourth time the Yankees slugger struck out.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:white; color: black">Mike Pence leaves 49ers-Colts game over protesting during national anthem</h2>
            <p style="background-color:white; color: black"><p>Vice President Mike Pence says he left Sunday's 49ers-Colts game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis because of protesting that took place during the national anthem.</p>
            <p>For the second week in a row, the 49ers had more than 20 players kneeling during the national anthem with their hands over their hearts. Teammates stood behind the kneeling players with one hand on a kneeling teammate's shoulder and the other over their hearts.</p>
            <p>The Colts wore black T-shirts with the words "We Will" on the front and "Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity" on the back for the second straight week. The players stood with their arms locked during the anthem.</p>
            <p>Pence tweeted a statement in which he said he would not dignify any event that disrespects soldiers, the flag or the anthem.</p>
            <p>On Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump said he had asked Pence to leave the game if any players knelt during the anthem.</p>
            <p>49ers safety Eric Reid said he believed Pence's actions were premeditated.</p>
            <p>"First of all, does anyone know the last time he's been to a football game?" Reid said after the game. "OK, with that being said, he tweeted out a 3-year-old photo of him at a Colts game. So with the information that I have, the last time he's been to a football game is three years ago. So this looks like a PR stunt to me.</p>
            <p>"He knew our team has had the most players protest. He knew that we were probably going to do it again. This is what systemic oppression looks like. A man with power comes to the game, tweets a couple things out and leaves the game in an attempt to thwart our efforts. Based on the information I have, that's the assumption I made."</p>
            <p>A former governor of Indiana, Pence had been in Indianapolis as part of the celebration of Peyton Manning and his jersey retirement and induction into the Colts' Ring of Honor during Sunday's game.</p>
            <p>Pence had tweeted a photo of him and his wife, Karen Pence, saying they were looking forward to cheering for the Colts and honoring Manning. But the Indianapolis Star noted that the photo appeared to be from 2014.</p>
            <p>The photo the vice president tweeted showed him wearing a Colts polo shirt. He was photographed wearing a suit during the national anthem Sunday.</p>

            <p>The pool reporter with the vice president had been told to stay outside the stadium and that Pence might leave the game early.</p>
            <p>Aides to the vice president did not respond to questions on whether he had planned to make the public walk-out in the game against the 49ers, who have regularly held the demonstrations.</p>
            <p>Pence has attended other NFL games, including December's Colts-Jets game at MetLife Stadium when he was the vice president-elect.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:black; color: white">Cam Newton: Was paying female reporter compliment, but 'sarcasm' faile</h2>
            <p style="background-color:black; color: white">
            <p>DETROIT -- Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton said following Sunday's win at Detroit that he was trying to give a compliment with "sarcasm'' earlier in the week when he laughed at the question of a female reporter.</p>
            <p>"It was a lesson learned for me this whole week,'' Newton said after he threw three touchdown passes in a 27-24 victory. "My sarcasm trying to give somebody kind of a compliment turned in ways I never would have even imagined.''</p>
            <p>On Wednesday, Newton made light of Charlotte Observer beat reporter Jourdan Rodrigue when she asked a question about receiver Devin Funchess embracing the physicality of routes and whether Newton got enjoyment out of that.</p>
            <p>Newton laughed and responded, "It's funny to hear a female talk about routes like ... it's funny."</p>
            <p>That started a firestorm around Newton that led Dannon Oikos Yogurt, one of the many companies the 2015 NFL MVP represents in commercials, to announce that it no longer would work with Newton and that his commercials would be pulled.</p>
            <p>ESPN's Adam Schefter, citing a source, reported Sunday that Dannon would replace Newton with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.</p>
            <p>Coach Ron Rivera said Thursday that Newton "made a mistake'' with his conduct toward Rodrigue. That evening, Newton released a video on social media apologizing for what he called "extremely degrading and disrespectful'' comments. He did not mention Rodrigue by name in the video.</p>
            <p>Rivera said Friday that Newton's apology was "something that needed to be said'' and that he hoped everyone could move forward from here.</p>
            <p>Asked what the past week was like, Newton said, "it's irrelevant.''</p>
            <p>"We're moving forward and just getting ready for Thursday now,'' he said of a primetime home game against Philadelphia, which, like Carolina, is 4-1. "At the end of the day, you still have to be a professional about certain things. With me and the preparation, it couldn't stop.</p>
            <p>"So I couldn't feel sorry for myself knowing that certain things took place that was out of my control. But at the end of the day, you live and you learn.''</p>
            <p>Rodrigue did not attend Sunday's game. Charlotte Observer executive sports editor Mike Persinger said she "is taking some time off.''</p>
            <p>Newton arrived at Ford Field with a pin in his hat showing the image of "Rosie the Riveter'' from the iconic "We Can Do It'' poster. "Rosie the Riveter'' was a symbol of feminism and women's economic power during the World War II era.</p>
            <p>"I was trying to find a way to kind of hint a notion to all the women,'' Newton said. "I did my homework on her and her impact on World War II. Not only on her, but all the women and females who played a big impact in creating equipment for World War II.</p>
            <p>"It was symbolization for inferior and strong women.''</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:white; color: black">Michael Jordan donates $7 million to build medical clinics</h2>
            <p style="background-color:white; color: black">p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Hornets owner Michael Jordan is donating $7 million to launch medical clinics that he hopes will help at-risk communities in Charlotte.</p>
            <p>It's the largest philanthropic donation ever by the former NBA champion.</p>
            <p>The donation will fund two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics, which are projected to open in 2020.</p>
            <p>"Through my years of working with Novant Health, I have been impressed with their approach and their commitment to the community," Jordan, a North Carolina native, said in a release Monday. "It is my hope that these clinics will help provide a brighter and healthier future for the children and families they serve."</p>
            <p>Jordan's spokesperson Estee Portnoy told The Associated Press on Monday that the Hornets owner "feels so great about being able to impact the Charlotte community and help people who really deserve it. Michael and Novant are really excited about this project."</p>
            <p>Portnoy said Jordan, 54, was motivated by a study that found poor children in Charlotte have the worst odds of those of any of the top 50 cities in the United States to lift themselves out of poverty.</p>
            <p>A release from Novant said the clinics will provide an avenue to affordable, high-quality care -- including behavioral health, physical therapy, social work, oral health and family planning -- to individuals in the community who have little or no health care.</p>
            <p>The clinics have the potential to decrease emergency room utilization by 68 percent and decrease hospitalization by 37 percent for the residents of these neighborhoods, according to Novant.</p>
            <p>Novant added that the clinics are projected to care for nearly 35,000 children and adults who do not currently have access to primary and preventive care or who use the emergency room for non-urgent medical needs.</p>
            <p>"This gift will transform the lives of thousands of families and children living in poverty-stricken communities," said Carl Armato, president and CEO of Novant Health. "We are thankful to Michael for his generosity. The gift will remove barriers to high-quality health care in some of the most vulnerable communities."</p>

            <p style="background-color:black; color: white"><p>Two-a-day workouts, studying a playbook, watching locker room footage:  these are some old-school ways for a young football player to improve their knowledge of the game. The newer, and much more popular way, however, is picking up a video game controller. </p>
            <p>In a report from the Washington Post's Jesse Dougherty, high school football players and coaches alike use the popular EA Sports video game Madden as a tool to hone their skills, learn the game and expand their terminology.</p>
            <p>"I've had coaches say, 'Go play Madden, go try things on there,'" said Ty Lenhart, a DC-area high school quarterback. "When you run concepts with your team, and then in Madden you see the same concepts but you see different tweaks and stuff, I think it really helps you understand the point of the play and the goal of it."</p>
            <p>The game was launched in 1998 and has released newer, more sophisticated versions nearly every year since. Developers now use input from current and former NFL players and coaches, and incorporate real playbooks. The Post's Doughtery also spoke with a coach who said he uses plays directly from video games, and quarterbacks who similarly study the game closely. </p>
