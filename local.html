            <p style="background-color:black; color: white">A young Minnesota teen is being praised for nearly saving the life of another teen
 that he came across lying in the street in Coon Rapids, Minn. 
The two live on different streets and go to different schools, crossing paths for the very first time.
<br />
<br />
“I happened to glance down this road, I see him laying right on this road. So I go
 down there to investigate,” 14-year-old Ian McDeid told Fox 9.  “And there's blood all
 over his face, 80 percent of his face was covered in blood.”
<br />
<br />
Haris Racic, 13, said after school he was heading home on his bike and then suddenly
 blacked out on Crocus Avenue -- “And the next thing I remember is just waking up in the
 middle of the road with Ian standing right above me asking me what happened."
<br />
<br />
McDeid comforted Racic, called 9-1-1, and waited until the ambulance arrived.
  His mom said he suffered a mild concussion, some cuts to his hands and face, and a
  shiner that hasn't fully healed. “If he wasn't there, who knows what could have 
  happened to me,” Racic said.
<br />
<br />
For now, what caused Racic to fall remains a mystery since there were no eye 
witnesses. But what's evident is that McDeid hopes this encourages others to stop and 
help others.“Just do it, even if you know you're running late for something,
 just do it,” he says. Once Racic gets to high school, he said promises to be a Good 
 Samaritan outside and inside the classroom.

            <p style="background-color:white; color: black">
            <p>Khalil Malik Watson was arrested in Las Vegas by U.S. Marshals on probable cause
                criminal vehicular homicide and criminal vehicular operation in connection with the
                crash, which took place in Jackson Township near the city of Shakopee on Sept. 14. 
                He was booked into the Clarke County Detention Center and will be extradited to 
                Minnesota.Five young people were inside the car when it left a dirt road and rolled,
                killing 16 -year-old Shakopee High School JaMason Moffett and critically injuring two others.
                Initially, a girl in the car told authorities that she was driving the vehicle, 
                but later admitted Watson was behind the wheel.
                <br />
                <br />
                The criminal complaint against Watson details how investigators recovered a 
                Snapchat video showing the defendant and some of the passengers of the Jeep SUV 
                consuming bars of Xanax and drinking beer before the crash occurred. They also 
                recovered text messages between Watson and a friend that confirms he was behind the 
                wheel. 
                <br />
                <br />
                “I killed someone on accident. With my wrap sheet there gonna charge me with 
                manslaughter. I’m gone forever accident or not,” the text read. Prosecutors say 
                Watson bought a one-way airline ticket to Las Vegas to stay with an uncle because he
                believed Nevada is a non-extradition state, and he would not be forced to return 
                to Minnesota to face charges.
                A computer module recovered from the Jeep shows the vehicle was traveling more
                than 90 miles per hour at the time of the crash, far faster than the 45 miles per 
                hour Watson's girlfriend had claimed earlier.
                <br />
                <br />
                "Unfortunately, tragedy can strike at any time, with no warning," Scott County 
                Sheriff Luke Hennen said in a released statement. "But I need to emphasize that there
                are often many factors within our own control that can help avoid incidents like 
                this one. Parents, grandparents, any loving adult – please stress the need for caution and attentiveness when talking with our young people about operating a 
                vehicle. Nothing is worth losing a life."

            <p style="background-color:black; color: white">
      <p>ST. CLOUD, Minn. - A St. Cloud woman Thursday pleaded guilty to killing her father.
          Lisa Kearney, appearing in Stearns County District Court for an ominbus hearing,
        admitted killing 66-year-old Jeffrey Eugene Schilling  in his home in early January
        2016. A couple days later Kearney was arrested in Louisville, Kentucky, and charged with second-degree murder.
        Judge Mary Mahler accepted the plea Thursday, and Kearney was returned to the 
        St. Peter Regional Treatment Center. Her sentencing is tentatively scheduled for
        Nov. 30. As part of her plea, the Stearns County Attorney's Office agreed it won't 
        ask for more than a sentence of 360 months.</p>
      <p>Kearney, now 40, had been living with her father. Police believed that she had a 
          strained relationship with him and they found her with his tablet, wallet and keys, 
          according to the police complaint. Since her arrest, Kearney was twice committed as 
          mentally ill. In August 2016 a judge ruled her incompetent to stand trial. She was 
          later found competent.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:white; color: black">Vegan 'Big Mac' gains popularity</h2>
            <p style="background-color:white; color: black">
            <p>ST. PAUL, Minn.- It's been around for decades and is still the most popular item 
                on the McDonald's menu... the Big Mac. You may even remember their catchy jingle... 
                "Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame 
                bun." "The Big Mac was developed by an owner operator so it was locally created in  
                Pittsburgh in 1967, so its 50 years old and its so popular that it expanded nationwide
                just a year later," said Yasmin Hyder, McDonald's Owner. So why are we talking about
                this iconic sandwich?</p>
            <p>J.Selby's, a new restaurant in St. Paul, is growing in popularity thanks in part 
                to their own version of the Big Mac. The only difference... it's made entirely from 
                plants and it's known as the "Dirty Secret". "What is a dirty secret for many vegans
    is that they kinda want to eat a Big Mac and we reimagined it as plant based... so 
    we use the herbivorous butchers beef patties, and cheese, and fresh toppings," said 
    J.Selby's owner Matt Clayton. So how does the "Dirty Secret" stack up with the Big 
    Mac? The MacDonald’s classic is higher in fat (28g) and calories (540), but lower in
    protein (25g) and price ($4.43). The Vegan version is lower both in fat (14g) and 
 calories (530) but higher in protein (38g) and price ($15).</p>

            <p style="background-color:black; color: white">
            <p>The woman accused of hitting and killing a Wayzata police officer with her car in 
                September had cocaine in her system at the time of the accident, the Hennepin County 
                attorney's office confirmed. Beth Freeman, 54, of Mound, was charged with two counts 
                of criminal vehicular homicide in connection with the death of officer William 
                Mathews, who was removing debris from the eastbound side of Hwy. 12 when he was run 
                over.</p>
      <p> Drug paraphernalia found in Freeman's car also tested positive for cocaine, 
          according to a search warrant. Freeman has three convictions for drunken driving and 
          another for driving under the influence of illicit drugs. The state revoked her 
          driving privileges at least three times, most recently in October. She also has at 
          least six convictions for drug possession. At the time of the crash, she was serving 
          three years' probation for a 2016 drug conviction.</p>
      <p> Convictions for drunken driving and another for driving under the influence of 
          illicit drugs. The state revoked her driving privileges at least three times, most 
          recently in October. She also has at least six convictions for drug possession. At 
          the time of the crash, she was serving three years' probation for a 2016 drug 
          conviction. Search warrant affidavits show that Freeman admitted at the scene that 
          she was a cocaine addict but had not used the drug for at least three years. The 
          charges against Freeman also allege that she was using her cellphone at the time of 
          the crash. During Freeman's recent court hearing, Judge Tamara Garcia denied her 
          lawyer's request to lower the $500,000 bail amount, the Attorney's Office said.
          Freeman's trial is scheduled to start in February. Her next court date is in December.</p>
